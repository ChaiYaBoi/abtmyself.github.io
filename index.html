    <h1>Hello World!!!</h1>
    <p>My name is Chaithra (Reddy) Marella :D This is my lil' zone in the world!</p>
    <p>It's nice, y'know, realizing that this is my forever mark on the world until the death of websites and the consuption of the world into flames.</p>
<p>No matter, whether you're here to see who I am, rate this website, learn a lil' more abot me, it's a pleasure to meet you!</p>
<p> As of 2024, I am a freshmen at Great Hearts. This school is nice. I like it. I've actally been here since kindergarden! I've always had a passion for the arts, whether it be actually drawing, or writing. I actually aspire to be a novelist as a side gig when I get older. I do traditional and digital art, and I apparetly have a kinda silly artstyle. I often listen to vocaloid songs, and I listen to the indie music genre, and dabble in some areas into the rock and metal realm.</p>
<p>I have several interests, like Sky: Children of the Light, Bungo Stray Dogs, Hoyoverse Games, and the Rick Riordan Books</p>

<p>I offer you this for I once got an adenoid surgery and I had to take the ibuprofen. Fun times.</p>
<p>I also rlly like Harry Potter, the games more than the books, actually!</p>

<p>This is Rowan Khanna from mobile game Harry Potter:Hogwarts Mystery. They're, because gender is variable for them, my favorite charater in the game, with Amit Thakkar from Howarts Legacy. Darn ye Jam City and Portkey games for no romance in legacy and not letting us, the fandom, date Rowan. And you just had to year 6 chapter 18 Rowan too. Shame. Shame.</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>That's all I really want to say :D I wanna get into areospace engineering when i get older, but honestly, the grind will be so real.</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>FAREWELL SOCIETY</p>
